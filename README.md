# uk-boundaries

A number of projects need boundary files as input into a pipeline. Those projects automate setup with scripts, but when some input files are not hosted statically somewhere in the correct form, making the scripts reproducible is challenging. <https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/> is a previous repo that worked around this by hosting the input files. The current ONS site does not offer static URLs to some files, and in fact some URLs to manually download a file have broken in the last year, so we are restarting this effort.
